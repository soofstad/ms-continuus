# ms-continuus

Github organization archive organizer

This program is meant to run as a cron job.  
It will do these things;

1. Start a Github Migration
2. Wait for the GH Migration to be ready for downloading
3. Download the archive
4. Upload the archive to AZ Blob storage with a metadata `retentionClass` value
5. Delete blobs where the retention limit is reached
6. Exit

## Configuration

ms-continuus is configured entirely with environment variables.

## (TODO: Waiting for Blob Idex Tags Preview Feature)

LifeCycleManagement is configured to delete old blobs following these rules;

- Blobs tagged with `retentionClass='weekly'` will be deleted after __60__ days
- Blobs tagged with `retentionClass='monthly'` will be deleted after __230__ days
- Blobs tagged with `retentionClass='yearly'` will be deleted after __420__ days

## Notes

- Github Migration archives are automatically deleted after seven days
- Some timings overview
    - Approx. 30min to migrate 100 repositories
    - 100 repositories with attachements ~= 6GB

## Developing / testing locally

You need to [generate a Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), with all the `repo`, and `user`
permissions.
